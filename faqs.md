## Do you cater to Allergies and Dietary requirements?

Whilst we follow best practice at all times, our dishes are created in an environment where allergens are prepared, stored and cooked. This makes it unsuitable for those with severe allergies, as we are unable to guarantee the menu will be completely allergen free.

**We cannot cater to vegans, vegetarians, pescatarians or dislikes.**

**_We are happy to accommodate pregnancy diets however, we will omit elements of our dishes rather than substitute them._**

For any other dietary requirement, please contact us via email or telephone to discuss with our team. Please inform us at least 72 hours prior to your booking date – otherwise we won’t be able to make the changes and you will still be charged.

If you are making a group booking, it is your responsibility to make us aware of any dietary requirements for all guests in your group.


## Can I cancel or modify my booking?

Yes, as long as we have at least 72 hours’ notice. Your £50 deposit is **non-refundable**. If there are any cancellations or amendments to bookings (in part or whole) with less than 72 hours notice, a full £120pp dinner fee will be charged (Your deposit will be included in this amount). This charge reflects the cost of food, drink and staffing incurred with short-notice changes.

Please see our [Terms and Conditions](/terms).

Our restaurant is an intimate setting; the largest table we can accommodate is for 6 guests.

If you would like to book a larger table, please email [info@restaurantjericho.com](mailto:info@restaurantjericho.com)
